# HotfixEngine

The "Hotfix Engine" is an easy-to-use, web-based game engine which allows players to affect back-end gameplay data through the manipulation of front-end elements. In other words, it is an engine whose logic is subject to change based upon the choices players make within the game. 

With personalization becoming a key element within the modern game, we feel that the methods developed for the "Hotfix Engine" should assist aspiring game developers in creating applications where users have control over the logic of their game.
